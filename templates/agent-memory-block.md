# MQ Memory Block

This repo is part of the MQ stack.

These instructions add MQ memory read-order rules. They do not replace
repo-specific build, test, safety, or release instructions.

## mqobsidian Location

Default local vault path:

`<MQOBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH>`

If `MQ_OBSIDIAN_DIR` is set, prefer that value.

## Read Order

For work related to `<REPO_NAME>`:

0. Read `.mq/context/task-pack.md` if it exists and matches the task.
1. Read `<MQOBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH>/memory/learn/agent/<REPO_NAME>.md` if it exists.
2. Read `<MQOBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH>/systems/<REPO_NAME>/hot.md` if it exists.
3. Read `<MQOBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH>/systems/<REPO_NAME>/index.md` if it exists.
4. Read `<MQOBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH>/memory/learn/repos/<REPO_NAME>.md` if it exists.
5. Read individual pattern notes only if the compressed notes are insufficient.

Stop reading as soon as the task is grounded.

## Low-Token Rules

- Prefer task packs and agent views over full notes.
- Prefer hot/index over pattern notes.
- Do not scan the whole vault by default.
- Do not open multiple pattern notes unless clearly needed.
- Summarize instead of replaying long note bodies.

## Source-Of-Truth Rule

`mqobsidian` is durable memory, not live runtime truth.

If the task depends on current code behavior, tests, contracts, CLI behavior,
or runtime state, verify in this repo before making claims.

## Writing Rules

When creating notes, summaries, or exports:

- separate facts, interpretation, and recommendation
- keep outputs compact
- preserve timestamps and provenance when relevant
- prefer links over duplicated prose
- avoid raw dumps

Do not store or copy secrets, tokens, internal hostnames, raw enterprise logs,
or machine-specific private paths.

## Fallback Rule

If `mqobsidian` is missing, stale, or too weak for the task, say so and verify
in the repo. Do not invent continuity.
